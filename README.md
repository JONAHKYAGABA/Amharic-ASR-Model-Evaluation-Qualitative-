# üó£Ô∏è Amharic ASR Model Evaluation (Qualitative)

This project evaluates **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)** models on Amharic audio datasets using Hugging Face's `pipeline`. It provides **qualitative feedback** through detailed CSVs showing predictions, references, and error metrics (WER/CER).

---

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Load one or more ASR models from Hugging Face
- Evaluate on Amharic-language test sets
- Compute **Word Error Rate (WER)** and **Character Error Rate (CER)**
- Save results in model-wise CSV reports
- Support batch inference and qualitative diagnostics
